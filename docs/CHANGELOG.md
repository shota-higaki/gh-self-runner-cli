## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-28

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGES

- Configuration files are now stored in a centralized directory (`~/.config/gh-self-runner-cli` by default) instead of the current working directory
- The `.github/self-hosted-runners` directory is no longer created in the current working directory

### ‚ú® Features

#### Configuration Management
- **Centralized Configuration**: Configuration files are now stored in `~/.config/gh-self-runner-cli` by default
- **Custom Config Directory**: Users can specify a custom configuration directory during `init`
- **Environment Variable Support**: Set `GH_SELF_RUNNER_CONFIG_DIR` to override the default location
- **Repository Reference**: A `.github-self-runner-config` file is created in the repository to reference the configuration location

### üîÑ Changes

- Configuration is now stored outside of the repository by default to reduce noise
- The init command now prompts for the configuration directory location
- All commands now use the centralized configuration directory
- The `.github-self-runner-config` reference file is automatically added to `.gitignore`

### üìã Migration Guide

For users upgrading from v0.1.0:

1. Run `gh-self-runner-cli init` in your repository
2. Choose a configuration directory (default: `~/.config/gh-self-runner-cli`)
3. Your configuration will be stored in the chosen directory
4. A reference file will be created at `.github-self-runner-config`
